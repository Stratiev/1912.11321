<p>This repository contains the code used for the numerical analysis performed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11321">arXiv.1912.11321</a>. The numerics was performed by computing solutions of the system of linear equations and calculating the various properties these solutions have (e.g. total energy, radius, total flux, peak value of B, etc) in MATLAB.</p>
